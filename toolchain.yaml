# Standard release channel toolchain names have the following form:
#        <channel>[-<date>][-<host>]
#        <channel>       = stable|beta|nightly|<major.minor>|<major.minor.patch>
#        <date>          = YYYY-MM-DD
#        <host>          = <target-triple>
#
# 'channel' is a named release channel, a major and minor version
#     number such as `1.42`, or a fully specified version number, such
#     as `1.42.0`. Channel names can be optionally appended with an
#     archive date, as in `nightly-2014-12-18`, in which case the
#     toolchain is downloaded from the archive for that date.
